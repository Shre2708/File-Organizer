# File-Organizer

Project was completed using the “fs module” and “path module” used to organize Files inside the given folder.
It is a command line Project.

In this project I created three different customized commands to help in organizing different files inside the folder.

First command is “help” command, used to show the list of all the commands we are having.

Second command is “organize” command, used to organize different files inside a directory 
in such way that similar type of file will be sorted inside a particular folder.

Third command is “tree” command, made by using recursion, used to give tree like path of 
different files types in a folder.
